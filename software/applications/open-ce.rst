Open-CE
=======

The `Open Cognitive Environment (Open-CE) <https://osuosl.org/services/powerdev/opence/>`__ is a community driven software distribution for machine learning and deep learning frameworks.

Open-CE software is distributed via :ref:`Conda<software-applications-conda>`, with all included packages for a given Open-CE release being installable in to the same conda environment.

Open-CE conda channels suitable for use on Bede's IBM Power architecture systems are hosted by `Oregon State University <https://osuosl.org/services/powerdev/opence/>`__ and `MIT <https://opence.mit.edu/>`__.

It is the successor to :ref:`IBM WMLCE <software-applications-wmlce>` which was archived on 2020-11-10 with IBM WMLCE 1.7.0 being the final release.
Open-CE does not include all features from WMLCE, such as TensorFlow Large Model Support. 


Open-CE includes the following software packages, amongst others:

* :ref:`TensorFlow <software-applications-tensorflow>`
* :ref:`PyTorch <software-applications-pytorch>`
* `Horovod <https://horovod.ai/>`__
* `ONNX <https://onnx.ai/>`__
